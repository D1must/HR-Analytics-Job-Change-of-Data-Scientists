Objective: Predicting a candidate's job change on an unbalanced dataset with a predominance of categorical features and a large number of missing values.

Short description: as part of the task, I performed a detailed analysis of the dataset with the identification of correlations, recovered the data using the kNN-method, and implemented machine learning using the XGBoost and CatBoost packages with setting the model hyperparameters. Received an estimate of prediction accuracy above 85%
